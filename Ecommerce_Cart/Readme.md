# Shopping Cart with Local Storage
This project is a simple shopping cart implementation using JS, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to add products to their cart, view the cart's contents, adjust item quantities, and proceed with checkout (with a mock failure for demonstration). The cart can also be saved to localStorage.

## Features
- **Add Products**: Add products from a dropdown menu to the cart.
- **View Cart**: See products added to the cart along with their prices and quantities.
- **Update Cart**: Increase or decrease product quantities or remove items from the cart.
- **Coupon Code**: Apply a coupon code to get free shipping.

## Demo
You can check out the project live (if hosted on GitHub Pages or other platforms), or just clone the repo.
